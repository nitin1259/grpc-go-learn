Now it is your turn to write code!

In this exercise, your goal is to implement a Sum RPC Unary API in a CalculatorService:

The function takes a Request message that has two integers, and returns a Response that represents the sum of them.
Remember to first implement the service definition in a .proto file, alongside the RPC messages
Implement the Server code first
Test the server code by implementing the Client
Example:

The client will send two numbers (3 and 10) and the server will respond with (13)

Now it is time for another exercise for server streaming RPC!

In this exercise, your goal is to implement a PrimeNumberDecomposition RPC Server Streaming API in a CalculatorService:

The function takes a Request message that has one integer, and returns a stream of Responses that represent the prime number decomposition of that number (see below for the algorithm).
Remember to first implement the service definition in a .proto file, alongside the RPC messages
Implement the Server code first
Test the server code by implementing the Client
Example:

The client will send one number (120) and the server will respond with a stream of (2,2,2,3,5), because 120=2*2*2*3*5
